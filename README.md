# Fake News Detection
The circulation of fake news is an emerging problem that threatens democracy, safety, freedom, and more. Social media is a place where people can exchange knowledge without any limitations. Unfortunately, when this opportunity is used with malicious intentions, it is easy to start a rumor that can change the course of events. Our proposed model uses LSTM (Long short-term memory) to detect fake news on social media. LSTM can learn from sequences that are hundreds of time steps long. The GloVe word embedding was also integrated to our LSTM model. In our research, two publicly available datasets called PHEME and Fake news detection on Kaggle are used. After pre-processing our data, our proposed model is deployed. Our results show us that our model can detect fake news on Twitter and news articles. It has also been tested how the subject to which a domain belongs according to the contents of the data affects the results. A better accuracy was achieved when the data is separated according to their domain. Our testing accuracy for articles that contain the 2016 US Elections-related content is 0.9973 when it is 0.8985 for single domain data of PHEME and 0.7988 for the multi-domain dataset. For future work, multi-modality and linguality can be implemented.
